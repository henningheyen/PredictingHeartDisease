# PredictingHeartDisease

Welcome to this notebook :)

This tutorial demonstrates the full machine learning pipeline and introduces fundamental concepts of a classification problem. The task is to predict whether or not a patient has a heart disease based on medical features. The dataset is taken from a [Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction). 

The notebook touches upon the following:

1. **Previous Work** that has been done on the same dataset including the literature and Kaggle.
2. **Exploratory data analysis** to get some insights about the dataset (characteristics and challenges)
3. **Preprocessing** including feature scaling, encoding and outlier handling. 
4. **Task and Evaluation**, i.e. choosing the right metric for the underlying problem.
5. **Design and build an ML system** using a flexible pipeline function. 
6. **Experimental analysis (performance & scalability)** by varying scaling and encoding techniques.
7. **Ethical considerations** with special focus on interpretability and biases.
8. **Sustainable development relevance & impact** with respect to the UN 2030 Sustainablity Goals.
